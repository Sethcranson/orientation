# Node.js

Node is a JavaScript _runtime_: a way of executing JavaScript code on many different platforms, independent of the browser environment. At EDA we use Node extensively, but not until Phase 1. During Phase 0 you don't need to install it unless you're curious and want to play around with the technology!

In Phase 1 you will be using Node every day on the EDA computers. If you'd like to work on problems at home, you are likely to need Node installed on your laptop or other home computer. Alternatives to this include various free online ways to deploy Node, including [Cloud9](https://c9.io), [HyperDev](https://hyperdev.com) and [NodeJS Console](http://www.node-console.com/service/node/help).


## nvm

To install Node, we recommend using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (nvm). This takes care of most of the trickier parts of keeping Node up to date for you. On OSX and Linux, installing it is pretty simple. Copy/paste the following command into your terminal window:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.7/install.sh | bash
```


## nvm-windows

Node on Windows is a little trickier, but definitely still possible. Try using [Node Version Manager for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases).

You may find [Babun](https://babun.github.io) useful as a Windows shell/terminal.
