# Pairing

Pair programming has gained in popularity among companies as enabling developers to learn quickly and make fewer mistakes, but it's not as easy as it may seem. Pair programming can enable both partners to learn and grow if communication is open, friendly, and based on mutual trust and respect. Building relationships like this takes practice, so we've incorporated pair programming into Phase 0!


[Pair Programming Considered Extremely Beneficial](http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/17/pair-programming-considered-extremely-beneficial/)

## Background on Pair Programming

[Pair Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) is an important part of the culture and teaching style of EDA.  We believe that everyone learns better by teaching and mentoring.

Additionally, pair programming and [Agile Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) are increasingly common in software development in general and pretty standard for Ruby on Rails jobs.  It is also likely to be part of the interview process.

Software Engineers pair in order to:

* reduce code errors and/or catch errors early
* share or transfer knowledge
* on-board new developers

That said pairing varies between teams.  Some pair 99% of the time; some pair only some of the time; others pair only when it makes sense.

Pairing [doesn't feel natural or easy for everyone](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2009/06/pair_programming_is_kryptonite/). We ask that you keep an open-mind on pairing throughout EDA and challenge yourself to work on your pairing skills while here.

## Expectations
As part of Phase 0, students are expected to pair program with a member of their cohort at least once a week.

* It is up to you to arrange pairing sessions with your cohort mates at a time that suits both parties**
* You should set aside at least 45 minutes for each pairing session
* You should work on any of the challenges
* When you arrange your pairing sessions, you should decide the following:
  1. What challenge to work on
  2. Whether you will 1) attempt the challenge first or 2) decide to save the challenge for your pairing session and not work on it before the session
  3. What time you need to finish the session


**Note: In most cases you should pair with someone in your accountability group.


## Courtesy

Please keep in mind that all students are busy and working hard to balance work and Phase 0 requirements. If it turns out you can not make the session you've scheduled with your pair for any reason, please contact your pair as soon as possible. Try your best to work from a quiet place with a reliable internet connection.


## Success Guidelines

You will be successful if you:

  - Check in with your pair according to the [Pairing is Caring](http://vimeo.com/76662569) video.
  - Decide which style of pairing you will use. If its driver navigator (recommended) decide who of you will be driver and navigator, discuss what each role requires, and stick with it.
  - Ask your pair to switch roles so you each know your responsibilities
  - Keep communication open and tell your pair when you need time to think
  - Ask your pair for their opinions and ideas often
  - Allow yourself to make mistakes
  - Provide feedback to help your pair improve
  - Use feedback you've received to become a better pair
  - Alternate roles. Aim to spend about 50% of your time in each role.


### Problems and Tips
Most students report that peer-pairing sessions are the most helpful and beneficial aspect of the Phase 0 program, but sometimes students report having bad sessions. Here are some tips for the common complaints we've heard.

**Problem: "My pair isn't responding to my messages."**
*Tip: How did you contact them? A number of students have had issues contacting others via slack. Try contacting your pair via email. If you still have difficulty, let your facilitator know and they can try to put you in contact with one another.*

**Problem: "My pair stood me up!"**
*Tip: Email or slack your pair and present your side from your perspective. If you say something like, "I felt upset and disrespected by..." Let them know that there actions had consequences. Note: Please do not use feedbackinator to address this kind of issue.*

**Problem: "My pair drove AND navigated during the session."**
*Tips: If you didn't clarify who would drive and navigate from the outset, you can ask to clarify it anytime in the session. If you did identify who would drive and navigate, but you feel you aren't able to play your role, you can ask your pair to take a step back on your duties so you can fulfill them. Try asking questions about potential design choices and offer your own ideas. Finally, if nothing is working, you can tell your pair that you need a break from the session and say you can reschedule for later since you don't feel the session is beneficial at the moment.*


## Pairing Arrangements

Within the industry there are a number of different pairing arrangements.  In each case, **two programmers code with only one person typing at a time.**

- **Driver-Navigator Pairing**
Driver-Navigator pairing involves the driver typing and the navigator talking and leading the driver.  The driver gives input, but should be focused on the area of code instructed by the navigator.  **The driver presses the gas, but the navigator says when to turn.**

- **Ping Pong Pairing**
This is probably the most common pairing technique professionally, particularly in [Test-Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) environments. It involves one person writing a test for the code and the other person writing the code to pass the test.  You may use this type of pairing in Phases 2 and 3.

- **Expert-Novice Pairing**
This is a variation of Driver-Navigator pairing, where one person is more knowledgeable about the problem or technique than the other. Depending on the goal of the pairing session, this can either involve:

-- **Expert Drives** The expert acts as a mentor helping to guide the novice in the right direction without giving away too much.  This variation is often used during job interviews.
-- **Novice Drives** This allows the expert to relay information and teach in a very focused way.  However, there is risk of the novice disengaging if the expert just tells him/her what to do.  Pairing should always feel like a conversation.
-- **Novice observes** In this scenario, the novice observes while the expert drives and navigates.  This can be used to demonstrate information, but should never be used for a full pairing session.

- **Switching Roles**
It is common -- and *expected* -- that pairs switch roles.

Ideally, switching happens organically.
Half way through each pairing session you and your pair should switch roles if you haven't already.


## Successful Pairing
Successful pairing requires two components:

**Good Communication**
Good communication during pairing is mainly through vocalizing your thoughts and thought process.
- If you don't understand, you should tell your partner.
- If you want to try something in IRB or NETRepl, tell your pair.
- If you want to go research something, tell your partner.
*Tell your partner everything you are thinking and doing!*

**Being on the same page**
Both people should know the exact line of code and the solution or concept they are discussing.

*Good pairing sessions feel like a conversation.*


## Remote pairing
Pairing remotely is more difficult than pairing in person.  You can't see a person's body language or face.  To be successful, **remote pairing requires discipline in adhering to pairing roles and excessive communication.**

While pairing in Phase 0, **you cannot communicate too much**.  For realz.

## Respectful Communication
I hope it goes without saying (but I will say it anyway) that pairing or any other communication during EDA should not involve inappropriate topics.  EDA is a respectful place filled with people of diverse backgrounds.  In particular, comments of a sexual nature or related to sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, disability, and class should never be made and will not be tolerated.  Please email your instructor if you feel another student violated this policy.
