# Vagrant

Vagrant is a tool for downloading and running virtual machines. Throughout this course, the most we'll ask of you with regard to Vagrant is for you to install it and use it to run virtual machines that we supply.

But in your work as a web developer, you may find yourself using Vagrant, Docker, or similar tools regularly. You can build your own virtual machines. You can also use Vagrant or Docker (or, weirdly, both) to create "virtualized servers" that you can upload to cloud hosting services (such as Amazon). This is a way to develop and run your application in the same "environment".

(The alternative method, which is that you develop on one machine and then deploy to another, is fraught with problems. Even slight differences in machine set up can cause serious headaches and down time. Virtualization is becoming more and more popular as a way around this problem. Of course, as you'll soon discover, like everything else we do as web developers, it comes with its own set of headaches.)

If you got the virtual machine set up and running for this orientation, you've already done everything we'll expect you to do with Vagrant. Now, doesn't that feel good?
