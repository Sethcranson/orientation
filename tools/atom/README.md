# Atom

[Atom](https://atom.io) is a popular open source text editor developed by GitHub and an increasingly large community. It's written in JavaScript and has become very popular with developers. We'll be using it from Phase 0 onwards. It's very easy to install extra features and configure it the way you like.


## Installation

To install Atom, visit [the install instructions](http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/) and, well, follow them! They're pretty extensive. If you need more specific help, try asking in the EDA Slack (use your cohort's channel.)


## Installing packages

There are a number of useful packages that make Atom more useful for editing JavaScript. The official documentation has a [page on installing packages](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/). Here's a list we suggest to start with:

  * atom-beautify
  * atom-ternjs
  * language-babel
  * linter-eslint
  * open-recent


## Using Atom

When you start to work with a new repository, you'll be doing this a lot:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo
cd your-repo
atom .
```

Notice the `.` after the `atom` command? That's `atom`, space, dot. The dot means, "Hey Atom: open the current directory!"
