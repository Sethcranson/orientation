# Code of Conduct

Dev Academy is committed to creating and protecting an equal, inclusive, and empathetic educational community. We are all stewards of this unique learning environment. Every one of us is responsible for upholding these values whenever we participate in all aspects of the EDA community.

We treat everyone with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, age, sexual orientation, ability, appearance, race, spiritual practice, religious affiliation, or any other personal characteristic. We reject words, actions, or images that express transphobic, homophobic, sexist, or racist ideas. We understand that sexualized content does not belong in an educational or professional setting. We aspire to find the courage to give each other actionable, specific and kind feedback if we witness behavior that harms our learning community. We resolve conflicts with listening and discussion, never physically or with threats. We listen, openly and with acceptance, to the experiences of people from all backgrounds. We work to notice and correct for our unconscious biases. We will keep learning and improving on the human skills that are at the heart of our transformative educational experience.
